I would like to apply radar to road cars for emergency braking, following an algorithm based on vehicle speed and distance.
objective: create an FMCW radar with 10GHz carrier frequency, maximum distance of 50 meters and radar-cross action detection of approximately 0.5 m^2.

This project is made for learning, I will not respect the legal limitations of transmitted power and available bandwidth.

1. Design the logical block diagram to achieve radar operation
2. set the parameters to be respected in the distances and in the band used, to understand the power to be detected and the losses
3. Calculate the free space losses, equivalent isotropic radiated power and solve the radar formula
4. Calculate the thermal noise and possible background disturbances, study the signal-to-noise ratio at the input and output
5. Calculate the chain of gains and losses and size the necessary components
6. Find the RF electronic components that have the calculated parameters
7. Create directional patch array
8. Design and arrangement of components on the PCB board
9. Pay attention to RF isolation and ground planes
